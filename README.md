# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
As part of the course "Data science &amp; Web Mining", we worked on a regression problem. Specifically, given a dataset consisting of a few thousand records containing the hourly count of rental bikes between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital bikeshare system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information. Our goal was to predict how many bikes would be rented each hour of a day, based on data including weather, time, temperature, whether or not its a workday, and much more. The dataset was taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Project was written in Python.
